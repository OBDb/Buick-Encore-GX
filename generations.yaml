    description: "The first-generation Buick Encore GX was a subcompact luxury crossover built on the VSS-F platform, positioned between the smaller Encore and larger Envision in Buick's lineup. Despite sharing the Encore name, it was a completely different vehicle than the original Encore. Power came from either a 1.2L turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 137 HP or a 1.3L turbocharged three-cylinder with 155 HP, paired with either a CVT (front-wheel drive) or nine-speed automatic (all-wheel drive) transmission. The interior featured premium materials, an 8-inch infotainment display with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and up to 50.2 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear seats folded. Safety technology included standard automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist, and available adaptive cruise control."

    description: "The second-generation Encore GX received a comprehensive redesign with bold, more upscale styling featuring Buick's new design language first seen on the Wildcat EV concept. The exterior adopted a sleeker profile with a forward-leaning front end, sharp character lines, and distinctive wraparound lighting elements. Inside, the cabin was completely reimagined with a more premium appearance featuring a 'Virtual Cockpit' composed of an 8-inch digital instrument cluster and 11-inch infotainment touchscreen in a single panel. The powertrain continued with a 1.3L turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 155 HP and 174 lb-ft of torque, paired with a CVT for front-wheel drive models or a 9-speed automatic for all-wheel drive variants. The new generation brought improved technology with wireless device charging, enhanced driver assistance systems, and Buick's QuietTuning sound insulation features. This redesign represented Buick's modernization efforts and attempt to attract younger buyers to the brand."
